# TODO/ideas for Style Transfer team

## Ideas


## TODO
1. Dowscale and upscale images to make the model more effective
2. Refactor and resturcture code for readability
3. Find more models
4. Tweak the current model. 
5. Find a style painting/image that transfers its style best to other pictures
    - Does the human portrait picutre matter as well? 

What we can tweak:
- Content loss vs. style loss

## Notes
- The picture to transfer the style from has a big impact on the result
- Higher resolution doesn't necessarily mean a better result
